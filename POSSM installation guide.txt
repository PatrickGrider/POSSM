POSSM was written for and on GNU Octave 7.1.0. you can always find the latest stable release at https://octave.org/download.
You will need the image package and the io package to run POSSM. They come with the Window's version of the installation, but may potentially
need to be downloaded seperately for other platforms.

Run the file "octave-7.1.0-w64-installer" in order to install the open-source MATLAB clone Octave. Octave is the platform that POSSM runs on.

Once octave is installed, open the file named "POSSM.m", this will open the source code for POSSM.

from here, POSSM's script can be run from either the Octave editor, by clicking the gear-with-yellow-triangle icon near the top of the editor,
or by typing "POSSM" without quotes into the Command Window (accessible by the tabs near the bottom of the window.

WARNING: running POSSM from the editor with the gear-with-yellow-triangle icon will SAVE ANY CHANGES YOU HAVE MADE TO THE CODE, intentionally or not. 
If this is how you would prefer to run POSSM, it is recommended you make a backup of the original file (from inside the "POSSM files" folder),
and edit the name to "POSSM_backup.m". Currently, the source code is set to "read only", so this should not be an issue, but caution is advised.

If you wish to make changes to the source code, you will have to, in the "POSSM files" folder, right click the POSSM version file and then
and uncheck the "read only" box.

if you decided to make a new shortcut instead there is an icon in the POSSM files folder named POSSM.ico that you can use.
